# Local Setup Guide

This is the fuller developer-oriented setup and behavior reference for the
current demo build.

## Use This Guide When

- you are developing features locally
- you need the canonical local environment setup
- you are debugging auth, quotas, review state, or persistence behavior
- you want the architecture and troubleshooting notes in one place

## Architecture At A Glance

- `frontend`: Next.js app with dashboard, trainer, review, knowledge, library, profile, admin, and developer flows
- `backend`: FastAPI app with auth, AI routing, safety gate, review queue, and TTS
- `main AI model`: Anthropic-backed analysis, coaching, debriefs, and knowledge generation
- `transcription`: OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`
- `auth persistence`: SQLite at `backend/app/data/auth.db`
- `review queue persistence`: `backend/app/data/review_cases.json`
- `session persistence`: browser `localStorage`
- `recommended hosted shape`: frontend on Vercel, backend on a separate persistent Python host

## Local URLs

- frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- backend: `http://localhost:8001`
- backend API base: `http://localhost:8001/api/v1`

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

The recommended defaults already live in `backend/.env.example`. After copying
it, make sure these values are correct for your machine:

- `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000`
- `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic`
- `AI_API_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
- `AI_API_KEY`: real Anthropic key
- `TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY`: real OpenAI key
- `PRIVATE_SEED_ACCOUNTS_JSON`: optional team-only private admin or developer accounts

Run it:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/api/v1
```

Run it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Account Model

The current public demo does not allow open signup.

Public seeded student accounts:

- `Student_1@gmail.com`
- `Student_2@gmail.com`
- `Student_3@gmail.com`
- `Student_4@gmail.com`
- shared password: `CODESTORMERS`

Public demo rules:

- each student account has `10` live sessions
- consuming a live session happens when a camera run starts
- only admin or developer accounts can reset the limit
- unknown usernames are redirected to `/access-required`

Private internal admin and developer accounts can be seeded through
`PRIVATE_SEED_ACCOUNTS_JSON`, but those credentials should never be copied into
public docs or screenshots.

## Persistence Model

Two storage layers exist:

- backend runtime data:
  - auth accounts
  - admin approval state
  - live-session quotas
  - session tokens
  - review queue state
- browser `localStorage`:
  - live session history
  - cached debriefs
  - local profile snapshot
  - knowledge progress
  - offline-first logs

That means:

- changing browsers does not carry over student session history
- deleting `backend/app/data/auth.db` resets seeded-account quota state
- deleting `backend/app/data/review_cases.json` clears persisted review queue state
- restarting the backend reapplies the latest seeded-account definitions from code and environment

## Main Routes

- `/login`
- `/dashboard`
- `/train/simple-interrupted-suture`
- `/review/[sessionId]`
- `/knowledge`
- `/library`
- `/profile`
- `/admin/reviews`
- `/developer/approvals`
- `/access-required`

## Live Trainer Behavior

Current demo constraints:

- one core procedure: `simple-interrupted-suture`
- each camera run is limited to `2 minutes`
- setup analysis can auto-run after the camera starts
- live analysis continues during the active run
- setup accepts clearly visible simulated surfaces such as an orange, banana, or foam pad

Fixed defaults in the demo build:

- `Simulation-only confirmation`: on
- `Audio coaching`: on
- `Offline-first logging`: on

Still configurable:

- `Skill level`
- `Feedback language`
- `Practice surface`
- `Learner focus`
- `Low-bandwidth capture`

## Verification

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build

cd ../backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

Useful smoke checks:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/procedures/simple-interrupted-suture
```

## Troubleshooting

- Login page still shows old seeded-account behavior:
  restart the backend so the seeded-account sync runs again.
- Live preview fails immediately with an Anthropic credential error:
  `AI_API_KEY` is missing, placeholder-only, revoked, or wrong.
- Frontend is deployed on a different origin:
  update `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in the backend and restart it.
- Learner voice is not transcribed:
  verify both browser microphone permission and `TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY`.
- Review page cannot find a session:
  session history is browser-local, so use the same browser profile that created it.
