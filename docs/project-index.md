# Deep Project Index

Last indexed: 2026-03-31

This document is a code-oriented map of the Clinical Curator AI hackathon repo.
It is meant to answer two questions quickly:

1. What exists in this repository?
2. Where does each important behavior live?

## Repo Snapshot

- Product: simulation-only clinical skills trainer focused on simple interrupted suturing practice
- Primary packages: `frontend` (Next.js 16), `backend` (FastAPI), `docs`, `open-library`
- Main experience areas: login, dashboard, live trainer, review/debrief, Knowledge Lab, library, profile, admin queue, developer approvals
- Runtime persistence: SQLite for auth and synced learning state, JSON file for human review queue, browser `localStorage` for cache and offline-first state
- AI surfaces:
  - analysis, coach, debrief, knowledge: Anthropic by default or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  - transcription: OpenAI-compatible speech-to-text
  - TTS fallback: Edge TTS, then `pyttsx3`
- Indexed code size:
  - `backend/app`: 47 files
  - `frontend/app` + `frontend/components` + `frontend/lib`: 33 files
  - `docs` + `open-library`: 13 files
  - Total indexed lines across major source/docs folders: about 25.9k

## Top-Level Layout

```

## Architecture At A Glance

```text
Browser
  -> Next.js frontend
     -> localStorage cache, offline logs, session/debrief cache
     -> /api/proxy/* in production
  -> FastAPI backend (/api/v1)
     -> auth.db
     -> learning_state.db
     -> review_cases.json
     -> procedure JSON
     -> AI providers
        -> Anthropic messages API
        -> OpenAI-compatible chat/transcription endpoints
```

### Main runtime loop

1. A learner signs in or creates an account.
2. The trainer loads the suturing procedure and restores the active session.
3. Starting the camera consumes one live-session allowance.
4. `analyze-frame` runs a safety gate first, then stage analysis, scoring, and optional human-review escalation.
5. `coach-chat` drives the voice loop, optionally transcribing learner audio first.
6. The review page generates or reuses a debrief, derives learner-profile patterns, and shows any review cases.
7. Knowledge Lab generates study packs from the same procedure and learner context.
8. Admins resolve flagged review cases; the fixed developer account approves admin access requests.

## What The Repo Is Optimized For

- Safe demo access through self-service signup plus seeded demo accounts for judging
- One polished end-to-end procedure rather than a broad procedure catalog
- Simulation-only enforcement before image-guided coaching
- Offline-friendly practice logging and browser-first recovery
- Human review escalation when the model is unclear, unsafe, or low-confidence
- Hackathon-friendly hosting with Vercel frontend plus persistent Python backend

### Important backend behaviors

#### 1. Safety-first analysis

- `analysis_service.analyze_frame_payload()` loads the procedure/stage, runs `safety_service.evaluate_safety_gate()`, and only then asks the main model for stage analysis.
- Blocked safety outcomes can create a human review case through `review_queue_service.create_review_case()`.
- Setup has a special fast-pass rule: if the setup frame clearly shows an approved inert surface, the service upgrades setup to `pass` even if the raw model said `retry`.
- Grading is separate from step status:
  - `unclear` is always not graded
  - low-confidence outputs can be not graded even if the model gave a coaching label
- Human review is triggered for:
  - `unclear` or `unsafe`
  - confidence below threshold
  - high-severity issues

#### 2. Voice coach loop support

- `coach_service.generate_coach_turn()` can transcribe audio first and append it into the chat history.
- It reuses the safety gate when an image is present.
- If transcription fails for a spoken turn, the service returns a blocked coaching response rather than crashing the loop.
- The coach prompt is optimized for short spoken turns, avoiding repetitive lectures.

#### 3. Auth model

- Public demo accounts are hardcoded in `auth_service.PUBLIC_DEMO_ACCOUNTS`.
- Self-service student account creation is enabled.
- Admin reviewer requests are created as student accounts first with pending developer approval.
- Optional private admin/developer accounts come from `PRIVATE_SEED_ACCOUNTS_JSON`.
- Passwords are stored with PBKDF2-SHA256 and per-account salts.
- Session tokens are stored in SQLite and issued on sign-in.
- Live-session quotas are tracked per seeded public/admin account.

#### 4. Synced learning state

- `learning_state_service` stores:
  - session payloads
  - active session per procedure
  - knowledge-progress counters
- Upserts are timestamp-aware: older session payloads do not overwrite newer ones.
- The backend normalizes `ownerUsername` to the authenticated account before storing.

### Important frontend behaviors

#### 1. Live trainer page

`frontend/app/train/[procedure]/page.tsx` is the single densest frontend file and owns:

- auth gate and procedure/session hydration
- camera lifecycle
- 2-minute hackathon camera window
- live-session allowance consumption
- auto-analysis for setup after camera start
- offline-first analysis fallback logging
- stage progression and review navigation
- hands-free voice coach loop with microphone recording and speech playback
- session persistence back into browser storage and synced backend state

If you change the main learner experience, start there.

#### 2. Browser storage ownership

`frontend/lib/storage.ts` owns the browser-side data model:

- auth user cache
- session list and active session pointers
- debrief cache keyed by session signature
- knowledge-progress cache
- migration when a username changes
- sync merge with backend learning-state snapshots

This file is effectively the frontend persistence layer.

#### 3. Review/debrief pipeline

`frontend/app/review/[sessionId]/page.tsx`:

- loads the owned session
- derives learner-profile context across same-procedure sessions
- reuses cached debriefs when the session signature matches
- requests a debrief only when needed
- stores the returned debrief back into the session cache
- loads human-review cases linked to that session

#### 4. Knowledge Lab pipeline

`frontend/app/knowledge/page.tsx`:

- derives recent issues from saved sessions
- requests study packs from the backend
- falls back to default topic suggestions when needed
- tracks rapidfire, quiz, and flashcard progress locally and via backend sync

## Procedure And Rubric Assets

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [../backend/app/procedures/simple_interrupted_suture.json](../backend/app/procedures/simple_interrupted_suture.json) | Runtime procedure used by the app |
| [../open-library/rubrics/simple-interrupted-suture.json](../open-library/rubrics/simple-interrupted-suture.json) | Reference rubric asset in the open library |
| [../open-library/rubrics/rubric-template.json](../open-library/rubrics/rubric-template.json) | Template for future procedure rubrics |
| [../open-library/benchmark/simulation_benchmark_manifest.csv](../open-library/benchmark/simulation_benchmark_manifest.csv) | Benchmark manifest stub/reference |

The repo currently centers the product around one procedure, but it already has a clear pattern for adding more.

## Persistence And State Ownership

### Backend-owned state

- Auth account records
- Password hash/salt state
- Session tokens
- Admin approval state
- Live-session quotas
- Synced session history
- Active session pointers per procedure
- Knowledge Lab progress
- Human review queue

### Browser-owned state

- Fast hydration cache for sessions
- Cached debrief payloads
- Offline practice logs
- Locally derived learner-profile views
- Workspace change events for reactive UI updates

### Sync model

- The frontend can operate from browser cache first.
- The backend is the durable source for cross-browser session history and knowledge progress.
- Review content is cached locally by session signature to avoid unnecessary regeneration.
- Offline analysis attempts are logged locally when connectivity drops and can still appear in review history.

   - [../frontend/lib/storage.ts](../frontend/lib/storage.ts) for persistence behavior

## Summary

This repo is not a generic full-stack starter. It is a tightly scoped, demo-safe training product with:

- one main procedure
- a deliberate safety gate before image coaching
- mixed self-service plus seeded-account access control
- browser-plus-backend dual persistence
- a human-review loop
- a clear expansion path for more procedures and richer study content

That makes the most important files disproportionately concentrated in:

- [../frontend/app/train/[procedure]/page.tsx](../frontend/app/train/[procedure]/page.tsx)
- [../frontend/lib/storage.ts](../frontend/lib/storage.ts)
