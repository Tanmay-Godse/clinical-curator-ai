# Deep Project Index

Last indexed: 2026-04-21

This document is a code-oriented map of the Clinical Curator AI repository.
It is meant to answer two questions quickly:

1. What exists in this repository?
2. Where does each important behavior live?

## Repo Snapshot

- Product: simulation-only clinical skills trainer focused on simple interrupted suturing practice
- Primary packages: `frontend` (Next.js 16), `backend` (FastAPI), `docs`, `open-library`
- Main experience areas: login, dashboard, live trainer, review/debrief, Knowledge Lab, library, profile, admin queue, developer approvals
- Runtime persistence: SQLite for auth and synced learning state, JSON for the human review queue, and browser `localStorage` for auth/session/debrief/knowledge cache. Backend runtime files are resolved through `runtime_data_path()`, which uses `backend/app/data` locally and `/tmp/clinical-curator-ai-data` on Vercel.
- AI surfaces:
  - analysis, coach, debrief, knowledge: shared JSON-message path over Anthropic or OpenAI-compatible endpoints
  - transcription: browser-first STT in the trainer, with OpenAI-compatible backend transcription for diagnostics and fallback
  - speech output fallback: browser speech first, then backend TTS via Edge TTS, then `pyttsx3`
- Indexed source size:
  - counts below exclude `backend/app/data/*`, `__pycache__/*`, and binary docs such as `.docx`
  - `backend/app`: 49 files / about 7.9k lines
  - `frontend/app` + `frontend/components` + `frontend/lib`: 33 files / about 20.6k lines
  - `docs` + `open-library`: 16 text assets / about 2.5k lines
  - Total indexed lines across major source/docs folders: about 31.0k

```

### Main runtime loop

1. A learner signs in or creates an account.
2. The trainer loads the suturing procedure, restores the active session, and runs setup preflight checks.
3. `Check Audio` can test Browser STT and backend transcription before grading starts.
4. Setup checks and setup-only preview stay local and do not consume a counted live session; the live-session allowance is consumed when real non-setup training starts.
5. `analyze-frame` runs a safety gate first, then stage analysis, grading/scoring, and optional human-review escalation.
6. `coach-chat` drives the voice loop, optionally transcribing learner audio first and reusing the safety gate for frame-aware coaching.
7. The review page hydrates the owned session, derives learner-profile patterns, reuses or generates a debrief, and shows linked review cases.
8. Knowledge Lab generates fresh study packs from the same procedure, recent issues, and prior prompt history.
9. Admins resolve flagged review cases; the fixed developer account approves admin access requests.

## What The Repo Is Optimized For

- Safe demo access through self-service signup plus seeded demo accounts for judging
- One polished end-to-end procedure rather than a broad procedure catalog
- Local setup verification and speech diagnostics before counted live coaching starts
- Simulation-only enforcement before image-guided coaching
- Offline-friendly practice logging and browser-first recovery
- Human review escalation when the model is unclear, unsafe, or low-confidence
- Hackathon-friendly hosting with Vercel frontend plus persistent Python backend

### Important backend behaviors

#### 1. Safety-first analysis

- `analysis_service.analyze_frame_payload()` loads the procedure/stage, runs `safety_service.evaluate_safety_gate()`, and only then asks the main model for stage analysis.
- The safety gate blocks immediately when simulation confirmation is missing or the learner text suggests a real-clinical context.
- For the simulation-only procedure, the safety service can fast-clear confirmed scenes without an extra safety-model round, and setup can still fall back to a cleared state when the safety classifier is unavailable.
- A learner, face, hands, or other person being visible is not a block reason by itself; the false-positive override explicitly clears benign non-clinical scenes.
- Setup still has a fast-pass rule inside analysis: if the frame clearly shows an approved inert surface, the service upgrades setup to `pass` even if the raw model said `retry`.
- Grading is separate from step status:
  - `unclear` is always not graded
  - low-confidence outputs can be not graded even if the model gave a coaching label
- Human review is triggered for:
  - blocked safety outcomes
  - `unclear` or `unsafe`
  - confidence below threshold
  - high-severity issues

#### 2. Voice coach loop support

- `coach_service.generate_coach_turn()` can transcribe learner audio first, append the transcript into the chat history, and trim the working conversation window before the model call.
- It reuses the safety gate when an image is present, so frame-aware coaching still respects the same simulation-only boundary as analysis.
- If transcription fails for a spoken turn, the service returns a blocked coaching response rather than crashing the loop.
- The coach prompt is optimized for short spoken turns, direct questions, and non-repetitive stage cues; the fallback path also knows when to wait for the learner instead of lecturing again.
- The frontend speech path tries browser STT first, but the backend transcription route remains available for setup diagnostics and fallback.

#### 3. Auth model

- Public demo accounts are hardcoded in `auth_service.PUBLIC_DEMO_ACCOUNTS`.
- Self-service student account creation is enabled.
- Admin reviewer requests are created as student-scoped accounts first, with `requested_role="admin"` and pending developer approval.
- Optional private admin/developer accounts come from `PRIVATE_SEED_ACCOUNTS_JSON`, and legacy private seeded accounts are cleaned out if they are no longer configured.
- Usernames are normalized to lowercase and stay globally unique across seeded and self-service accounts.
- Passwords are stored with PBKDF2-SHA256 and per-account salts, with legacy hashes upgraded on successful sign-in.
- Session tokens are stored in SQLite and issued on sign-in.
- Live-session quotas are tracked per seeded public/admin account, while developer access can remain uncapped.

#### 4. Synced learning state

- `learning_state_service` stores:
  - session payloads
  - active session per procedure
  - knowledge-progress counters
- Every read/write is authenticated through `X-Account-Id` and `X-Session-Token`, and cross-account session id takeover is rejected.
- Upserts are timestamp-aware: older session payloads do not overwrite newer ones.
- `make_active` is explicit on session upserts, so saving and switching the active pointer are separate decisions.
- The backend normalizes `ownerUsername` to the authenticated account before storing.

### Important frontend behaviors

#### 1. Live trainer page

`frontend/app/train/[procedure]/page.tsx` is the single densest frontend file and owns:

- auth gate plus procedure/session hydration after opportunistic backend sync
- reset-to-clean-run trainer startup while preserving older sessions for review
- local setup verification for backend reachability, secure context, camera, microphone, speech path, network, and quota
- `Check Audio` shortcut plus the deeper `Mic and speech test` panel that can compare Browser STT against backend transcription
- setup-only preview and setup-stage checks that do not consume the counted live-session quota
- real live-session activation, 2-minute demo window, pause/resume, and quota refresh
- manual `Check My Step` analysis flow, including local setup pass/fail synthesis and automatic setup-to-stage advance
- offline-first analysis fallback logging
- hands-free voice coach loop with proactive turns, browser-first speech capture, backend fallback, and duplicate-guidance suppression
- pause/end session controls, footer audio insight cards, and session persistence back into browser storage plus synced backend state

If you change the main learner experience, start there.

#### 2. Browser storage ownership

`frontend/lib/storage.ts` owns the browser-side data model:

- auth user cache
- session list and active session pointers keyed by owner + procedure
- debrief cache keyed by review signature
- knowledge-progress cache plus recent question/front history
- migration when a username changes
- sync merge with backend learning-state snapshots

This file is effectively the frontend persistence layer.

#### 3. Review/debrief pipeline

`frontend/app/review/[sessionId]/page.tsx`:

- syncs from the backend before hydrating the owned session
- derives learner-profile context across same-procedure sessions
- builds a local adaptive drill fallback even before the server debrief arrives
- reuses cached debriefs when the review signature matches the session plus learner profile
- suppresses debrief generation in offline mode when offline practice logging is active
- stores the returned debrief back into the session cache
- loads human-review cases linked to that session

#### 4. Knowledge Lab pipeline

`frontend/app/knowledge/page.tsx`:

- hydrates persisted knowledge progress per signed-in learner
- derives recent issues, latest skill level, latest language, and focus area from saved sessions
- requests study packs from the backend with study mode, selected topic, recent issue labels, and history to avoid repeated prompts/cards
- keeps one active pack request at a time so a new response does not immediately retrigger another pack generation cycle
- falls back to default topic suggestions when needed
- renders explicit loading and empty states for rapidfire, quiz, and flashcards while a pack is still being generated
- tracks rapidfire timers, quiz scoring, flashcard mastery, and total points locally and via backend sync

## Procedure And Rubric Assets

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [../backend/app/procedures/simple_interrupted_suture.json](../backend/app/procedures/simple_interrupted_suture.json) | Runtime procedure used by the app |
| [../open-library/rubrics/simple-interrupted-suture.json](../open-library/rubrics/simple-interrupted-suture.json) | Reference rubric asset in the open library |
| [../open-library/rubrics/rubric-template.json](../open-library/rubrics/rubric-template.json) | Template for future procedure rubrics |
| [../open-library/benchmark/simulation_benchmark_manifest.csv](../open-library/benchmark/simulation_benchmark_manifest.csv) | Benchmark manifest stub/reference |

The repo currently centers the product around one procedure, and the library page also ships a bundled fallback copy so the guide can still render when the backend procedure fetch fails.

## Persistence And State Ownership

### Backend-owned state

- Auth account records
- Password hash/salt state
- Session tokens
- Admin approval state
- Live-session quotas
- Synced session history
- Active session pointers per procedure
- Knowledge Lab progress
- Human review queue

### Browser-owned state

- Auth user cache
- Fast hydration cache for sessions
- Active session pointers
- Cached debrief payloads
- Knowledge progress and recent question/front history
- Offline practice logs
- Locally derived learner-profile views
- Workspace change events for reactive UI updates

### Sync model

- The frontend can operate from browser cache first.
- `useWorkspaceUser` and several routes opportunistically call `syncLearningStateFromBackend()` to refresh the local cache.
- The backend is the durable source for cross-browser session history, active-session pointers, and knowledge progress.
- Review content is cached locally by review signature to avoid unnecessary regeneration.
- Offline analysis attempts and offline practice logs still appear in local review history even when cloud services are unavailable.

   - [../backend/app/services/auth_service.py](../backend/app/services/auth_service.py) for access and quota behavior
   - [../backend/app/services/analysis_service.py](../backend/app/services/analysis_service.py) for AI behavior
   - [../frontend/lib/storage.ts](../frontend/lib/storage.ts) for persistence behavior

## Summary

This repo is not a generic full-stack starter. It is a tightly scoped, demo-safe training product with:

- one main procedure
- local setup plus speech diagnostics before counted live coaching starts
- a deliberate safety gate before image coaching
- mixed self-service plus seeded-account access control
- browser-plus-backend dual persistence
- a human-review loop
- a clear expansion path for more procedures and richer study content

That makes the most important files disproportionately concentrated in:

- [../frontend/app/train/[procedure]/page.tsx](../frontend/app/train/[procedure]/page.tsx)
- [../frontend/lib/storage.ts](../frontend/lib/storage.ts)
