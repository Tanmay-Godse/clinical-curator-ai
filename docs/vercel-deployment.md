# Vercel Deployment

This document covers the recommended hosted shape for the `frontend`.

## Recommended Split

- deploy `frontend` on `Vercel`
- deploy `backend` on a separate persistent Python host

Why this split is recommended:

- the frontend is a standard Next.js app and fits Vercel well
- the backend owns SQLite auth and quota state
- the backend owns review queue persistence
- the backend handles longer AI and transcription calls
- the backend currently expects one explicit `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` value for CORS

For backend-specific deployment steps, use
[backend-deployment.md](backend-deployment.md).

## Vercel Project Settings

In Vercel:

1. Import the GitHub repository.
2. Set the project root directory to `frontend`.
3. Keep the framework preset as `Next.js`.
4. Add the production environment variable below.
5. Deploy.

Required frontend environment variable:

```env
API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.example.com/api/v1
```

The production app proxies browser requests through `/api/proxy/*`, so
`API_BASE_URL` stays server-side in Vercel and is not exposed to the public
client bundle.

## Backend Alignment

Your backend must separately allow the deployed frontend origin:

```env
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-project.vercel.app
```

If the backend origin does not match the deployed frontend exactly, the frontend
will load but API calls will fail.

## Preview Deployment Caveat

The backend currently allows one exact frontend origin.

That means:

- one stable Vercel production URL is the safest demo setup
- Vercel preview URLs will not work automatically unless backend CORS is widened in code

## Public Demo Notes

The deployed login page intentionally shows only the four public judge accounts.

That is by design:

- fixed public student accounts reduce API abuse
- each account has `10` live sessions
- unknown usernames route to `/access-required`
- quota resets are reserved for admin and developer accounts

## Post-Deploy Smoke Checklist

1. Open `/login`.
2. Sign in with one judge account.
3. Confirm `/dashboard`, `/knowledge`, and `/library` load.
4. Start a live session and confirm analysis requests reach the backend.
5. Confirm `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` matches the deployed frontend URL exactly.
